// maybe it is just a stylistic thing?
// so we have an event mechanic that can turn on and off different events
// but the implementation of each one must be defined within a different mechanic.
// or, the settings and their weights are defined separately
// but then it is really hard to adjust relative weights...
// this would be solved if we just didn't need them to be relative.
// does that make it more interesting anyways?
